# Link shorter

That's super simple service on Django + React

## Why

I made it to learn React, in fact it's my first project using it.

## How

I simply create random slug for user's link, give user my (shorter) link which redirects to original url. Super simple.

## Is that the end??? :cry: :cry:

Probably yes, I don't see this project actually useful in novadays. I think it's the final version therefore (it's not perfect btw).
